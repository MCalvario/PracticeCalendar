# Work Day Calendar

## Description
As a full stack web developer, I want to create a daily planner for an employee with a busy schedule to add important events so that he/she can manage his/her time effectively.

# Usage 
To use this daily planner to create a schedule, first, open the application.  The current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar.  When you scroll down, you will be presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm.  View the time blocks for that day. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.  Click into a time block to enter an event.  When you click the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage.  Refresh the page to see that the saved events persists.
